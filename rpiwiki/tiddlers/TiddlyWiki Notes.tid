*comment out sections of a wiki `<!-- this is a comment -->`
* a transclusion is like a #include, in that it in-lines another tiddler, and looks like this: `{{Surface Go 2 GPS}}`
* you can display what would normally be wiki markup by wrapping it in single backticks
* you can disable CamelCaseAsALink like this: `~FooBar`
