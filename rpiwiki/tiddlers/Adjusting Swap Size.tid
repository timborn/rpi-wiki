title: Adjusting Swap Size
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Useful after fixing to boot off USB drive [[How To Boot Off USB Device]].

The default size is 100MB which, except when it has to be a RAM disk, is pretty small.
Rule of thumb: 2x RAM.

Edit /etc/dphys-swapfile and comment out fixed 100MB size (or adjust).
Alternative is to enable "auto size calc".

That's it.
