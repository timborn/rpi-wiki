title: Using JT-Bridge for Notifications
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I use JT-Bridge on the mac.
Not sure what all it does, but under Preferences / Notifications you can set up email and/or iMessage notifications for states/countries not worked, or when someone is calling you.
Useful when chasing that last state for WAS, for instance.
