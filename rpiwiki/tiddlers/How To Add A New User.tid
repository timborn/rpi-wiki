There is probably a way to do this through the GUI too.  

```
$ sudo useradd timborn -G sudo -m -s /bin/bash
```
-G sudo -- I want to be part of the sudo group

-m -- create a new $HOME directory

-s /bin/bash -- this is the $SHELL I like


NB there is no password on this new account, so you may want to set one:

```
$ sudo passwd timborn
```
