title: How to Change hostname in CentOS7 on RPi
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can change the hostname of your RPi from the command line:

```
[timborn@localhost ~]$ sudo hostname rpi3.local
[sudo] password for timborn: 
[timborn@localhost ~]$ hostname -f
rpi3.local
[timborn@localhost ~]$
```
According to the man page for hostname, this change is only temporary, and will be lost upon next reboot.
Apparently editing /etc/hostname is the more permanent solution.

Also notice that the prompt in that example encodes the hostname, and yet it didn't change even after we proved that the hostname had changed.  
This is an example of a change outside the current shell.
Any terminal windows opened subsequently will have the correct hostname shown.

TODO: explain editing /etc/hostname, and the format of that file

In the Gnome GUI:

Applications / System Tools / Settings / Sharing -- change hostname

To test to see that your changes have worked:

```
yes, master> hostname -f
```


That should show the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for your machine.
