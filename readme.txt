This solution depends on having tiddlywiki server available.  On the mac you can install this using

$ brew install node
$ npm install -g tiddlywiki

Trying to figure out how best to save notes. 
I quite like TiddlyWiki.  Any way to share this with a wider audience?

Installed TiddlyWiki on Node.js as an experiment.
I believe this will open a webserver that I can expose.
Test to make sure changes get saved.
Figure out how to make backups.
